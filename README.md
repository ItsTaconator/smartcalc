# smartcalc
A somewhat advanced cross-platform command-line calculator written in Rust. It has features such as:
- Comments, starting with `//` or `#`
- User-defined variables (+ built-ins such as Euler's number, Euler's constant, and Pi)
- continuations (using the last result as the first operand in an expression)
- line references (using the result from a specific expression in a different one)
